The use of inclusive ranges in Rust leads to suboptimal code. The loop using the inclusive range finished in some microseconds, while the loop using the exclusive range finished in mere nanoseconds. When viewing in Compiler Explorer the same functions with the [-C opt-level=1](https://rust.godbolt.org/z/zWfYW3dP5) flag, the results show thereâ€™s far more assembly generated by the inclusive range than the exclusive range. The conclusion is to prefer using *Range* rather than *RangeInclusive*.
