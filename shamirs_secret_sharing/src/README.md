The provided Rust code implements a secret-sharing scheme using Shamir's Secret Sharing. The algorithm divides a secret *S* into *n* pieces of data, called shares $ S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n $, such that knowledge of any *k* or more shares $S_i$ allows the reconstruction of the secret *S*. It utilizes the Lagrange interpolation theorem, which states that $k$ points on a polynomial uniquely determine a polynomial of degree less than or equal to *k - 1*. The secret *S* can be expressed as a *constant term* $a_0$ over a finite field $GF_q$, where $a_0$ must be less than the size $q$ of of that field. To construct the polynomial, randomly choose $k - 1$ elements $a_1, \ldots, a_k-1$ from $GF_q$, and create the polynomial $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 * x + a_2 * x^2 + a_3 * x^3 + ... + a_{k-1} * x^{k-1}$. Compute any $n$ points from it using incremental indices for the $x$ coordinate ($i$, $f(i)$). Given any subset of $k$ shares, the secret $a_0$ can be reconstructed using the Lagrange interpolation formula

$$
S(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \left( y_i \cdot \prod_{\substack{0 \leq j \leq n \\ j \neq i}} \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j} \right)
$$

Where:
- $y_i$ are the share values.
- $x_i$ are the indices of the shares.
- The expression $ \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j}$ represents a fraction that needs to be computed for each share.

In this formula, we evaluate the polynomial at a specific point based on the given shares, involving division by the Lagrange denominator, a product of terms. The code employs Fermat's Little Theorem to compute modular inverses, assuming $q$ is prime.
